## Project

**Project Name**: **Book Finder Objective**:

The main objective of this project is to create a web application where users can search, view, create, update, and delete books.

**Requirements**:

**Setup & Initialization**

- Create a new React project using Create React App.
- Set up a GitHub repository for your project.
- Install necessary dependencies like `axios` for making API requests and `react-router-dom` for routing.

**Designing the Application**

- Create a wireframe or a mockup of your application using tools like Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, or Canva. Your application should have at least two pages: a List page and a Detail/Edit page.

**API**

- Use an API to fetch book data. For this, you can use the Google Books API, Open Library API, or if you prefer, you can use JSON placeholder API for mock data.

**List Page**

- Display a list of books on this page. Each list item should minimally display the book title.
- Add a "Delete" button for each book in the list, clicking this button should delete the book.
- Add an "Edit" button for each book in the list, clicking this button should take the user to the Detail/Edit page.
- Add a "Create" button on this page, clicking this button should take the user to the Detail/Edit page where they can enter details for a new book.
- Add a search bar or search field to filter through the books.

**Detail/Edit Page**

- Display detailed information of a book on this page.
- Allow the user to edit the details of the book and save them.
- If the user came to this page by clicking the "Create" button, allow the user to enter details for a new book and save it.

**Routing**

- Implement routing properly to navigate between pages.

**Deployment**

- Deploy your application to Netlify or any hosting platform of your choice.

**Optional Advanced Requirements:**

- Add user authentication.
- Save user's favorite books and display them in a separate list.
- Add sorting functionality to the book list.

**Submission Guidelines:**

- The final code should be pushed to your GitHub repository.
- Update the README.md file with details about the project, how to setup, install, and run it.
- Include the live URL of your hosted application in your repository description and README.md.

**Rubrics:**

- Functionality: Does the application do what was asked?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and reusable?
- Design and Usability: Is the application easy to understand and use?
- Responsiveness: Is the application viewable on all screen sizes?
- Completion: Is the application fully implemented and working?

Good luck with your project! Remember, the key to a successful project is good planning and time management. It's important to start early, break down the project into manageable tasks, and work on them one by one.
