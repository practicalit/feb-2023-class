## Course Overview and Expectations:

In this comprehensive, project-based course, you will learn how to build a modern, full stack web application using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Throughout the course, you will gain practical experience by developing an Employee Management App, which will serve as a platform to apply the concepts and techniques you learn in each module. By the end of this course, you will have a strong understanding of full stack development, and you will be able to create, manage, and deploy web applications confidently.

### Key Learning Outcomes:

1. Gain a deep understanding of the core technologies used in modern full stack web development, including React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
2. Develop proficiency in essential JavaScript (ES6) features that are widely used in web development.
3. Master state management and routing techniques in React applications.
4. Learn to create and style user interfaces using popular React UI libraries and CSS-in-JS solutions.
5. Understand the fundamentals of backend development using Node.js and Express, including routing, middleware, and handling HTTP requests.
6. Learn how to work with MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, and Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
7. Design, implement, and consume RESTful APIs for seamless communication between frontend and backend applications.
8. Integrate the frontend and backend components of your application, connecting your React app with a RESTful API.
9. Learn testing methodologies and tools for both frontend and backend components, using Jest, React Testing Library, and Supertest.
10. Understand and apply best practices for project structure, code organization, and optimization.
11. Deploy your full stack application to cloud platforms and hosting services, such as Heroku, AWS, Netlify, and Vercel.
12. Gain hands-on experience by developing an Employee Management App, reinforcing the concepts learned in each module through practical application.

### Exepectations:

As we begin on this journey together, there are certain expectations we want to share to ensure you gain the most from this course.

#### Class Activity:

Participation in class activities is crucial part of your learning process. Through descussions, problem-solving activites, and coding exercises, you will have a chance to reinforce what you have learned and put theory into practice. We strongly encourage you to particpate actively and engage in dialogue with your peers and instructors.

#### Submiting Projects:

One of the key aspects of this course will be a comprehensive project that you will work on throughout the duration of the course. The objective of this project is to provide you with a hands-on oppotunity to apply what you learn in each session. This will aid in better understanding and assimilating the concepts, principles, and methods we'll explore. You're encouraged to start working on the project from the very beginning of the course. This way, each new concept learned can immediately be put into practice, solidfying your understanding and retention of the material. As we move through the course, we expect your project to evolve and refine as well. Project instructions can be found in `project.md` file. Please also note that submiting Projects on time is **REQUIRED** to move to the next phase of the course.

#### Attendance:

We have a minimum attendance requirement of 80-85% for this course. Regular attendance is critical because it provides you with the opportunity to learn directly from the instructors, ask questions, and participate in live discussions. In case you are unable to attend a session, please inform the course instructor beforehand.
